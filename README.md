## Overview

This is my submission for an internship role at Nupat Teams.
This assessment was designed to test my design skill and attention to detail, summing up my
ability to reproduce a pixel-perfect implementation of the given design and Also how I
structure my code.

### The challenge

A figma file was provided and the main page was to be designed using ReactJS. I also included some hover states for certain components.

## My process

I had to optimize my workflow since I was given two days to complete the full design and I have never worked on a project as large as this before. I should also note that it has been a month since I started learning ReactJS and had to learn how to set up React on my local environment.
I ended up using Vite to create this React App and broke down each sections of the page into React Components which also have smaller components.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- ReactJS

### Continued development

I would like to design more responsive webpages using React as I develop, as well as consolidating my knowledge of React hooks and how to write cleaner code.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fifrxpx-gmw&t=0s) - I was able to optimize my workflow and got the idea of breaking down the webpage into component sections from this video
